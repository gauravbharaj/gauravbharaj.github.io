                            Abstract</h3>
                        Reconstructing a three-dimensional representation of
                        human motion in real-time constitutes an important re-
                        search topic with applications in sports sciences, human-
                        computer-interaction, and the movie industry. In this paper,
                        we contribute with a robust algorithm for estimating a
                        personalized human body model from just two sequentially
                        captured depth images that is more accurate and runs
                        an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-
                        the-art procedure. Then, we employ the estimated body
                        model to track the pose in real-time from a stream of
                        depth images using a tracking algorithm that combines
                        local pose optimization and a stabilizing database look-
                        up. Together, this enables accurate pose tracking that is
                        more accurate than previous approaches. As a further
                        contribution, we evaluate and compare our algorithm to
                        previous work on a comprehensive benchmark dataset
                        containing more than 15 minutes of challenging motions.
                        This dataset comprises calibrated marker-based motion
                        capture data, depth data, as well as ground truth tracking
                        results and is publicly available for research purposes.
