            An animation of an actor created with our method from a multi-view video database.
            The motion was designed by an animator and the camera was tracked from the background
            with a commercial camera tracker. In the composited scene of animation and background,
            the synthesized character and her spatio-temporal appearance look close to lifelike.</h5>

              Abstract</h3>
            We present a method to synthesize plausible video sequences of humans according
            to user-defined body motions and viewpoints. We first capture a small database of
            multi-view video sequences of an actor performing various basic motions. This database
            needs to be captured only once and serves as the input to our synthesis algorithm.
            We then apply a marker-less model-based performance capture approach to the entire
            database to obtain pose and geometry of the actor in each database frame. To create
            novel video sequences of the actor from the database, a user animates a 3D human
            skeleton with novel motion and viewpoints. Our technique then synthesizes a realistic
            video sequence of the actor performing the specified motion based only on the initial
            database. The first key component of our approach is a new efficient retrieval strategy
            to find appropriate spatio-temporally coherent database frames from which to synthesize
            target video frames. The second key component is a warping-based texture synthesis
            approach that uses the retrieved most-similar database frames to synthesize spatio-temporally
            coherent target video frames. For instance, this enables us to easily create video
            sequences of actors performing dangerous stunts without them being placed in harm’s
            way. We show through a variety of result videos and a user study that we can synthesize
            realistic videos of people, even if the target motions and camera views are different
            from the database content.
